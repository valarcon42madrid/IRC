                  AN INTER RELATED CHAT (SERVER):

- You could start it with "make" and then "./ircserv 6667 Password".

- You could connect to it by "nc -c 127.0.0.1 6667" and then would be able to do:

· NICK
(to define your nick)
    "NICK v"

· PASS
(to join with the server password)
    "PASS Password"

· USER
(to define the user's parameters)
    "USER valarcon 6667 127.0.0.1 victor"

· JOIN
(to join a specific channel)
    "JOIN 6667"

· PING
(Simple test that only has a phatic function or to measure the time it takes for data packets to travel)

· PRIVMSG
(a private message to an user)

· NOTICE
(a message to a target [user or channel])

. LIST 
(shows the channels and topics)

. PART
(to leave a channel)

. QUIT
(to stop the connection with server and quit)

      JUST WITH PRIVILEGES: 

->  MODE
(changes the configuration of a channel)

   "MODE channelName +/-Flag "TARGETifNEEDED""

- K puts key in a channel ("MODE mychannel +k password" means that to access you must do "JOIN mychannel password")
- L establishes the limit of clients
- N disables external messages (that is, +n prevents NOTICEs to the channel)
- "+b" bans a client, "+t TOPICNAME" creates a topic in the channel, "+i" makes it only accessible by receiving an invitation.

    EX: "MODE 6667 +b userToBan"

-> INVITE Channel Nickname 


-> KICK
(to kick out somebody)
  "KICK 6667 v : BecauseIhateYou"


      TO TEST AT A DIFFERENT CLIENT (WEECHAT):

 - Start Docker Engine and open weechat by it:
    "docker run -ti weechat/weechat"

 - WATCH THE SERVER'S MACHINE IP:
    "ifconfig | grep inet"
(*and we copy the 1st inet after the inet6, one with netmask and brodcast below) (host.docker.internal CAN ALSO BE USED FOR YOUR OWN COMPUTER)

    AT WEECHAT:

 - ADD THE SERVER:

/server add ANYNAME (I.P.consulted)/6667 -tls

 - IMPORTANT STEPS:

desactivate tls: /set irc.server_default.tls off

Insert password: /set irc.server.ANYNAME.password (PASSWORDFROM./IRCSERV_6667_HERE)

 - CONFIGURATE AS YOU WANT:

/set irc.server.libera.username "My user name"

/set irc.server.libera.realname "My real name" ...

 - CONECT:

/connect ANYNAME

/join "GROUP"

/query TARGET mensaje
